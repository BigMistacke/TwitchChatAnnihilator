# Twitch Chat annihilator
Finally, a way to randomly ban your chat for no reason at all!

## Todo
1. ~~Set up annihilation screen with hard-coded rule~~
2. ~~Set up file loading for rules~~
3. ~~Set up Rules screen~~
4. ~~Set up settings~~
5. ~~Finish rule set~~    
6. Set up Lexicons
    - Import & save text files
    - Username as usable text
7. Set up Lexicon screen 


# Bugs
- TwitchManager doesn't shutdown when app is closed (fixed?)
- EventManager select_rule() doesn't check if there are no rules
- Fails silently in a bunch of places
